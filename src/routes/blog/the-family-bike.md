I'm now an avid cargo bike Dad. I've been into bikes for years, and have always enjoyed exploring on two wheels with my kids. Over the last few years the rides have become more infrequent.

The problem: we'd never get far. The older one would want to ride her own bike, but get tired early into the ride. And the younger one would want to come along too.

I purchased a Trail-gator attachment, which was great. But, the rides became more difficult and less fun, pulling the extra weight.

I started looking at other ways to make it more enjoyable and came across the Tern GSD. I decided to make this the main bike for the family. The bike has some serious cargo carrying capacity and the electric motor just makes it fun for all of us.

I'll be publishing the trails and adventures we go on. And reviewing the equipment we use. Giving you a glimpse of what it's like to have a cargo bike in the family.
